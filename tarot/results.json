        "General": "In general, this card would indicate new beginnings that have some deeper spiritual meaning - for example, starting a meditation practice or a relationship, as opposed to buying a new pair of shoes. The appearance of the fool can depict an important \"fresh start.\" ",
        "Work" : "Other people may not understand or support your new ideas and/or proposals, but if you know that you're right, press ahead, and try to help them to understand where you are coming from. This sometimes will indicate finding a new position - or even that the time could be right for you to \"go off on your own\" and start your own business.",
        "Love": "The appearance of the Fool in the context of love could mean that you aren't ready for a commitment yet, even though others may be pressing you for one. This is a positive harbinger for your love life; lots of fun seems to be in the offing. Just don't let your desire for fun make you overlook \"the real thing\" (real, true, deep love) should it come your way now.",
        "Finances": "In terms of finances, the Fool is an extremely positive significator. You can expect increase, and furthermore, you will find it in yourself to know that no matter what happens financially, that you will be all right and will \"come out on top.\" Trust yourself, work hard, and you will do better than you expect.",

Overall, though, when this card appears your health is very likely to be on the upswing. If you're having health problems, you are very likely to find the people and items you need to make headway toward a full recovery. Positive thought is important and should come fairly easily to you now. ",
        "Spirituality": "When this card appears, you are likely to have a desire to try out lots of different approaches to spirituality to see how they \"fit.\" Nothing wrong with this exploration, however don't get too carried away in any one thing while you are \"just shopping.\" This card can indicate a powerful need to get deeper knowledge about spirituality, and your friends and family may not understand where this is coming from. Regardless, you have to do what is best for you."

You should be finding that you have the knowledge, strength, and inspiration needed to meet your challenges. In general this is a very positive time for you. ",
        "Work":" There will be an improvement in your work/career life. This points to an excellent time to find new work or to ask for and receive a promotion in your current job if that is possible. Particularly if your work is in a creative field, this is a time when your suggestions and work will be met with excellent comprehension and may lead you to \"bigger and better things.\" ",

Have faith in yourself and your ability to succeed.",
        "Health": "If you've been feeling ill, that will most likely end soon; this card signifies strength and/or the return of strength. If you do have some kind of ongoing health issue that hasn't gotten better, you may benefit greatly from undertaking some sort of alternative therapy (nutritional counseling, massage, dietary restriction, and so forth.) ",
        "Spirituality": "This is an excellent time for you to undertake some form of spiritual study that you've thought about in the past but haven't had the opportunity to pursue. You would benefit, also from discussion groups that are spiritual in origin. A spiritual teacher may appear in your life now.

        "Work": "It's possible that a pleasant surprise will be coming your way soon in regard to  work. This could even be a new job opportunity. You may come up with some new systems or processes that make your work life simpler and less stressful. Ignore workplace gossip and certainly don't get involved in it. ",
        "Love": "This can be a magical, mystical time for love. If you date women, you could well be interested in a woman who is distant and unapproachable. Trust your instincts. If you are a woman, you may well find people basically literally throwing themselves at you. Use this power wisely- it's potent!",
        "Finances": "Someone may not be being completely honest with you in regard to finances. You may not have all the information that you need. Don't be afraid to dig deep, and to do your own investigating. Be sure, when it comes to financial transactions, that you give out only the information that is needed and no more. ",
        "Health": "There may be information about your health that has not yet come to light. If you feel that something is amiss with your body, believe in your concerns and advocate for yourself. You may need to see a different health care practitioner. Trust yourself. If a procedure or test that is suggested to you doesn't \"feel right,\" don't feel that you have to go through with it. Be sure that you are supporting yourself as best you can with diet, exercise, and vitamins/minerals. ",
        "Spirituality": "Messages can come to you from all sorts of places. Make a point to look at spirituality in ways that you have not done before. Talk to people whose experiences and beliefs are different than your own. Move out of your comfort zone. You'll be all the richer for it. "

This will be beneficial to you because you are now going to be able to see yourself more in the way that others see you - as someone with wisdom, and a lot to offer. So share your hard-won perspectives on life, know that your wisdom and caring is valuable.",
        "Work": "Things should be going very well for you. People will be inspired by your ideas, your passions, and your way of doing things. Let your ‘inner voice' guide you in how you operate. The empress directs us to follow our bliss, and that the rest will follow. ",
        "Love": "This is a potent time for love, you may find that men and women alike are suddenly finding you far more attractive (both in terms of friendship and romance,) and you will want to be careful with how you use this power, as it's very potent. If you are single, this is a time when love - true love - could very well come your way. Committed relationships often become sweeter, deeper, and truer under this influence. ",
        "Finances": "This card shows an excellent time to make investments, follow your instincts about them. Money should be flowing very well. Be sure to \"keep the flow going\" by putting back out a little of what you have, to a person or cause that is important to you. Share your abundance.",

If you're not ready to be a parent and pregnancy  is a possibility for you, this is a time when you want to be triply careful. If you're having health issues of any kind, ponder them from a different point of view; what is your body trying to tell you? Consider adding some sort of naturopathic or homeopathic approach to your health regime. ",

It will be important to listen closely to it now and if that requires that you make time alone, even though there are others that need you, then making time alone needs to be a priority.

Perhaps he will be interested in you romantically. If so, don't rule him out, just because of his age. You may feel that this man sort of \"rules with an iron fist\" and that can be frustrating at times, but he is trying to help you to see that rules have their place and their reasons - and you will come out all the better for it. Above all else, this man teaches - without even trying, perhaps - the benefits of structure and logic ruling over the emotions and lesser desires. ",
        "Work": "Work should be going well and your efforts will not be going unnoticed. Pay particular attention to organization, follow-through, and logic. Your results should be stellar. If you are looking for work, now is a time to be dispassionate, to step outside yourself and think about how others see you from a logical point of view; play up the logical reasons why they should hire you. You are likely to be successful in finding work if you make a logical and sustained effort now. ",
        "Love": "You may find yourself falling for someone who is older than you now. This person is likely to be attracted to order, logic, and organization. The attraction may not be mutual from the very beginning, but if you are patient and persistent, it is likely to grow. ",
        "Finances": "This card shows a need for discipline, logic, and order to make your finances work better for you. What we pay attention to in our life grows. Are you treating your money with respect? Do  you know how much you have, where it is going, and so forth? Do not focus on lack now, because lack is then what grows. Pay attention to what you have, and be the best steward of it that you can be. ",
        "Health": "Believe in your right to good health. Be logical about what you are doing to your body. Order and discipline may be helpful. For example, if you are struggling with a health issue, write down your symptoms, track them, and then see if anything in your life corresponds with your systems. Consider an \"elimination diet\" to check for food intolerances. ",
        "Spirituality": "Be sure to take time out for yourself in order to honor your need for spiritual growth. Do not focus totally on your left-brained aspects (logic, reason, order,) but allow your right brain to have input too. Logic can lead you to the spirit, if you allow this, and if you don't get too stuck in your logical self. Meditation, (which requires great discipline) will come easier for you now if you make the time and effort."

There may be a tension between your idea of spirituality and the \"right thing\" and the ideas of others around you. Stand up for your own beliefs. The \"rules\" and the \"system\" of doing things are probably playing a major role now. Rituals of any sort will be helpful to you now, even if it's just \"a movie with friends every third Saturday.\"",
        "Work": "You may find that a teacher or mentor of some sort that you have been needing appears in your life now…and/or you could be called upon to be that teacher or mentor for someone else. This is a good time to get involved with groups even if you don't think of yourself as a \"group person,\" as you will find that you have much to learn from them (in a very positive way.) Work should be going very well provided you are able to be organized and work within the rules.",
        "Love": "Romance also is likely to be going very well, although in a pretty traditional way (i.e. these energies will work best for you if you can conduct yourself in whatever way someone in your shoes is \"expected\" to be. Now is not the time to \"buck the system\" or to be unconventional any more than you have to be.",
        "Finances": "This is a time to play by the rules and to use down-to-earth, normal, traditional ways to handle your money. Seek the advice of bankers and professional money managers and/or people with more experience dealing with money than you have. This is a good time for investments, provided they are conservative and stable. This is not a good time for taking chances with money or going for \"unusual\" stocks, bonds, etc. ",
        "Health": "Ritual of any kind is helpful to you now. If you have health challenges, discipline, order, and commitment - in whatever way that makes sense to you - is the way to go about it. \"Traditional\" therapeutic means also have a high chance of success now. ",
        "Spirituality": "You are very much concerned with spirituality now (even if you don't have anything approximating a \"traditional\" religious belief. Make regular time, even if you don't attend a \"traditional\" house of worship - to quiet yourself and allow your spirit some time to expand. What matters here is the regularity of it - whether it's daily, weekly; whatever you can make time for. You will see changes in your life and outlook as a result of giving yourself this time."

      "content": {
        "General": "It's possible when this card appears that you are feeling ambivalent about a relationship or situation in your life. It could be that your heart is telling you one thing, and your head, another. In general, the thing to do is (within the bounds of your morality) to follow your heart. Some people say there are only two modes that any of us are operating under at any time; and that's \"fear\" or \"love.\" When you can: choose love. ",
        "Work": "You may be facing a choice or decision in relation to work. Analyze all available information, then make your best choice. It's possible that what you initially interpret as a bad thing will turn out to work in your favor. Be cautious about mixing business with romance; if you chose to go there, make sure you know exactly what the stakes are.",
        "Love": "When this card appears, it usually means this time is likely to bring LOVE in capital letters to the center stage of your life. This is either a new relationship, or a powerful re-bonding of an old one. Either way you will be quite happy about how romance is going and others will likely remark that you are \"glowing.\" This is serious stuff. It could mean, even in a new relationship, where you are meeting each other's families and talking about \"forever.\" Again, share your joy with those around you who need it. Life will feel blissful to you now, which is wonderful.",
        "Finances": "Things are likely to be going so blissfully for you romantically that it would be easy for you to lose track of where you are with your personal/financial life.  Most things can wait, of course, but some things absolutely can not so just be sure that you don't lose sight of the things you really must do. ",
        "Health": "If you are facing health challenges, know that the right partner to help you get back to wholeness will come to you. Whether that's a traditional doctor, nurse, or healer depends a great deal on your preferences and choice in life. Again, if you are facing challenges, think deeply about your current understanding about health and wellness, and undertaking any healing affirmations/forgiveness work that you may need to do. ",
        "Spirituality": "Again, working with a special person, like a mentor or leader that you have faith in can help you along your spiritual journey. However, don't blindly follow; question everything, listen to your heart and your gut reactions; take what is offered that is helpful to you, and disregard the rest. A mentor may be getting ready to come into your life. Remember the old saying: \"When the student is ready, the teacher appears.\""

      "content": {
        "General": "In general this card points to determination and ambition, getting things done, and testing and proving what you've got. This is a sign that you should move forward with whatever you have in mind (and in your heart) and give it your best shot. Remember, though, that you'll need to use both your intellect and your heart, in order to be truly successful. ",

There may be someone who is involved with your work who is (inadvertently or not) working against you. Don't let this get you down, either. Just do the best you can and don't waste time on worrying about the way others perceive your efforts. If you're right (and you probably are) everyone will see this in the end anyway. You should be feeling very \"charged up and ready to go.\"",
        "Love": "In terms of love, it's possible that you are tempted to go too far too fast and/or that someone is pressuring you that way. Either way, communicate as best you can about your boundaries and preferences and be honest with yourself about the possibilities. If you aren't interested in a relationship with someone who clearly wants one with you then the kindest thing you can possibly do is to let them know that you just aren't interested. The short term angst this may cause will benefit everyone  in the long run. ",
        "Finances": "Finances in general may be going very well. You could be looking into purchasing something to do with transportation - a car, plane tickets to somewhere you have always wanted to go - anything of that nature. Prioritize paying down your debts. You can do it now if you are disciplined. ",
        "Health": "On the whole your vitality is very strong now and you should have quite a lot of \"get up and go.\" This is an excellent time to begin or to increase a fitness plan. You may be able to make more progress than you ever thought possible. ",
        "Spirituality": "You may travel (even locally) to places that can help increase your spiritual awareness and you will be in a mode where you learn a lot quite quickly about spiritual matters. Don't be afraid to attend seminars and talks on spiritual subjects that seem unfamiliar to you or outside your usual mode of learning. You can benefit in ways that you cannot currently imagine if you do try these new things. This can be a very profound time for you. "

        "General": "It's important now for you to make time to meditate and contemplate and spend some time alone even if you are in a committed relationship and have nineteen children! Do not allow yourself to spend time in preoccupation and fear.  Outward things will be going all right but what is of the most paramount importance is keeping your head on straight.",
        "Work": "Work should be going well. If you're looking for work, know that you have the wherewithal and the skillset to find it. If you're already employed, and there is room for upward mobility, don't hesitate to negotiate for what you're worth. You might be surprised at the positive reception that you get. If there's not room for a raise or promotion where you are now, give serious thought to finding something where there is this possibility, or consider what it would take for you to strike out on your own business-wise. You may have more options than you typically think possible.",
        "Love": "Love should be going very well - if you're committed, this is very likely to be a strong relationship that is mutually supportive and beneficial. If you're looking for someone, this is a much better-than-average time to meet people. You should be in a self-confident phase, so get out and mingle. You might be very pleasantly surprised by how things work out. ",
        "Finances": "Money should be in a positive cycle. Be sure to save some, even if it's only a little, and even if you've been doing without for quite some time and feel a desperate need to treat yourself or the people that you care about. You may actually be getting ready to purchase a home or other big-ticket item. Don't borrow more than you can comfortably repay, of course. ",
        "Health": "Your health and vitality should be strong and robust now. This is a great time to correct bad habits if you need to do so in order to protect your health. Starting with small goals like a daily ten-minute walk could very well lead you to where  you want to be, which is even healthier and stronger than you're feeling right now. Yes, it can get better!",
        "Spirituality": "This is likely to be a very spiritual time for you even if you don't have anything close to a religious belief. To be truly strong, you must pay attention to and develop each leg of the triad we are made from: body, mind, and spirit. Be sure you are spending time on all three. That's hardest to do when things are difficult; if you receive this card when you are at a low point, know that things are very likely to be looking up soon.

Even if it's just a five minute walk around the house so that you can clear your head. This is also very much a card about \"trying very hard to do the right thing.\" Just make sure that \"doing the right thing\" includes doing what is right for you personally, and not just worrying about the wants and needs of others. ",
        "Work": "You are nearing the point where work success and recognition are well within your grasp. Do your best to be organized and productive. This will pay off for you in ways that aren't clear yet. Do the \"right thing\" even if nobody is watching. You are always watching what you are doing.",
        "Love": "It's possible that a romance from your past will be re-kindled. Is that really what you want? It seems that romantic relationships are not currently a priority for you right now. If your head says that you want nothing more than a romantic relationship; look at your behavior. Does it align with that analysis? In a committed relationship, you might have been moving in different directions for a while now. Make sure to make the time and effort to stay connected in order to keep the spark alive. ",
        "Finances": "This is a time to be conservative when it comes to financial transactions and decisions, not that money seems to be your highest priority when the Hermit appears anyway. If you're investing, put your money in conservative stocks/bonds/money market with really good track records. This is not a time to gamble. ",
        "Health": "Ritual of any sort will be helpful to you health-wise. (this could even be something like reading a book for an hour every Saturday afternoon). Any health problems could be drawing your attention to a problem that is not in your body so much as in your life; for example, a bad back could indicate that you are \"carrying too much\" metaphorically speaking. Take care of yourself. ",
        "Spirituality": "It's very likely that at this time a person will come into your life who is like a mentor or teacher even if they don't \"teach\" you directly. You will still learn from them on several levels. Honor the need that you may be having  to withdraw to a degree from ordinary life - It won't last forever. You will soon be feeling much more social, so don't push yourself now to be around a lot of people unless it is absolutely necessary. You will likely emerge from this month feeling refreshed and renewed, particularly on a spiritual level. "

If suddenly you find yourself \"sitting on top of the world,\" keep your perspective, as that too, like everything else, changes. Live in the now, count your blessings, and just realize that much of life is outside of your control, but that even that is okay. Roll with any changes, and think positively.",

You are being called to follow your dream, no matter what it is. If you have a desire to do something different, but don't know anybody who does what you want to do - be bold, and call up someone who does what you dream of doing, and ask them if you can have lunch with them or shadow them for four hours. You'd be surprised how often such a request is met in the affirmative.",

This does not mean that, if you are in a committed relationship, that it is doomed, but only that you will need to take action to make sure that it makes it. Talk about how you are feeling, that's your best hope. If you're looking for a relationship, first get very, very clear on exactly \"who\" you are looking for, then get out and mingle - whether that's online or by allowing friends to introduce you to someone that might \"fit the bill.\"",
        "Finances": "In the financial sense the Wheel of Fortune is generally a good omen for anyone who has been having a rough time for a while financially. It means that your circumstances are very likely to change, markedly, for the better. However, if you have had a long prosperous period, consider the opposite possibility, that your income may drop a little. If that's the case, be sure you are prepared for the proverbial \"rainy day.\" In the long run, of course, it all evens out. ",
        "Health": "Resisting change can be bad for your health. Do whatever it takes to keep your stress level under control. When in doubt, go back to the basics; proper nutrition, proper rest and proper exercise go a long way toward helping. Meditation and Yoga may help keep you in top-shape also. ",
        "Spirituality": "It's important to be aware that in nearly all instances, we do make a contribution in some way to what is happening in our lives. It is rare for things to \"just happen\" or for us to be a truly blameless \"victim\" in a situation. Accept whatever your fair share of responsibility is for the situation you are currently facing, be accountable to yourself if to no one else, and move on. Sometimes things do \"just happen,\" if that is the case - rest assured you are by no means alone in that experience, and reach out for support. The support you need is truly always available."

        "General": "This card evokes the need for fairness, balance, and harmony. Operate in as balanced and reasonable a fashion as you can. This includes in how you think about and treat yourself. If you are directly involved with a court case, it is likely to be resolved, at least in large degree, in your favor. ",
        "Work": "You need to be sure that your work/life balance is where it needs to be. Too much emphasis on either throws the other into balance. For most people, one or the other comes more easily to us; be sure that regardless of which field (personal life or work) you feel most comfortable in, that you are giving the other part of life as much attention and energy. Balance is necessary in order to thrive. ",
        "Love": "If you are questioning whether you and your long-term partner are likely to stay together, often when this card appears, the answer is that you are likely to choose to go your separate ways. On the other hand, if you are single, this is a time when commitment may be coming your way very shortly.  Stay clear about what you most want from relationships, and you are likely to \"find it\" that much sooner. ",
        "Finances": "This is a good time for games of chance. Very often, when this card appears in the context of money, it can mean that a (usually fairly small) \"windfall\" is coming your way. Even if you don't gamble in any way, money that you weren't expecting can show up now. That's always a good thing. Use it wisely.",
        "Health": "It's important to \"stay in the moment\" and, once again, to pay attention to how you are (or are not) keeping a sense of balance in your life. Moderation is not just for monks, it's an important part of living a sensible and healthy life. Consider how you might be \"out of balance\" - particularly if you have a health challenge now and remedy the situation. You have the power to do so.",
        "Spirituality": "This is a time to work on being grounded. Do you feel as though you are connected to the earth and your fellow man? Can you be \"in the world\" but not \"of the world?\" Balance again is the theme here. Working on keeping the proper perspective about life will help you to stay centered."

        "General": " It's possible that there is an outdated attitude or wish that you need to let go of. Any sacrifice that you make will open up your life to something even more positive than what you \"let go of.\" All in all this should be a thoughtful, reflective time, particularly if you are willing to look at if or how you might best serve your own interests by being willing to change.",
        "Work": " Nothing much may seem to be happening, and you may well be sick of it. This is a great time to figure out if there is anything that you personally can do about it, if this is the case, and if there is not an action that you can take, then try not to take the slowness of the wheels of change personally. Things will change. It just may not happen on your timetable. Relax, or else look for different work. ",
        "Love": " Again, the theme can be one of letting go. \"Letting go\" of an unattainable lover, for example, will bring about the possibility that someone that you can be with will \"be there\" for you. But that is only one example. You may need to \"let go\" of a vision of a particular kind of relationship as being \"the only way that you can be happy.\" If you're in a long-term relationship, it too may well be at a crossroads. If you think the relationship is fabulous, be sure and find out \"where your partner is\" with the state of affairs.",
        "Finances": " If things are tight, this is an important time to \"open up the flow\" of prosperity by giving away some of what you have, even if all you have is a piece of bread. If that's the case, know that there is someone nearby who would probably give their right arm to share that piece of bread with you. Find them, and share it. Something as simple as this may start the wheels turning to bring your \"prosperity\" into better times. ",
        "Health": " You may change your mind radically about something that you think is wrong with you physically. This is not a siren song to just ignore everything your doctor has told you, but give it some deep thought, do some research. It's possible that something you thought you understood could best be treated in another way. Your health improves,  but it's a process. ",
        "Spirituality": " It's crucial now to let go of any negative, self-limiting beliefs. Remember the idea of the \"self-fulfilling prophesy\" and be very careful about what you allow yourself to say or think about our life. Make sure the \"prophecies\" you are making about your life bear some resemblance to the life you really wish to see."

        "General": " The more accepting you can  be of change of all sorts during this time, and the less you try to \"control\"  the better and the more comfortable this time will be for you. Often what you  need to \"let go of\" is some sort of self-limiting belief or attitude. Sometimes  we just can't see how our attitudes are hurting us, and when that is true, this  time period can be a wake-up call. The energy of this time is not just change or destruction; it is change or destruction  followed by renewal. Even though one door may have closed, another is opening.  Will you have the courage to step through? ",
        "Work": " If you hate your job, or are \"underemployed,\" but  you've not wanted to leave because of the steady income, you could end up being  forced out. Ultimately, this would lead to your \"greater good,\" but wouldn't  you rather leave on your own volition? You may benefit most from a complete  change of field. Make the leap. You can do it. ",
        "Love": " If you are clinging to a relationship that you are  deeply unhappy in because you don't want to let go of the familiar, or because  you hate to be alone, you are doing neither yourself or your partner any  favors. Have a frank and honest discussion about the problem(s) you have with  the relationship, and if they can't or won't make a change or you can't or  won't, then perhaps it's time to let it go. If you can be brave and take the  chance of leaving the security of this relationship, you can find one that  works much better. But first, you have to face the problem, and try to fix it.  Not all relationships are fixable. Don't beat your head against a wall for very  long. You'll know when it's \"long enough.\"",
        "Finances": " You may have to make some sacrifices to deal with  coming financial challenges. You can do it. Don't hesitate to reach out for  help if you need it. You don't have to struggle or suffer alone, nor should it  come to that, although there is a possibility that you'll be dealing with an  involuntary loss of income as your job may be cut back, your stocks may lose  money etc. Don't avoid reality, if this comes about. Figure out exactly what you  are dealing with, face the situation, then do what you must to get through it.  Ultimately you will profit greatly from what you have learned. You'll be fine  in the long run. ",
        "Health": " Keeping your stress level manageable is a must in  order to stay in good health now. Deal with any problems that come up  physically, don't try to avoid them. Be sure to get enough rest, as best you  can, and don't abuse your body with alcohol or in other ways. If you need  healing, ask for it on both the literal and the spiritual planes. Especially if  you are single, now, seek out being touched physically; massage, and hugs from  dear friends, etc., will go a long way toward keeping you healthy and sane.",
        "Spirituality": " Cultivate a positive attitude. Know that even  if you are in the midst of a \"dark night of the soul\" that this too shall pass.  Don't fight change. Allow yourself to feel what you feel, but don't wallow in  pain or sorrow; if you need help pulling yourself away from any pain or loss  that you are suffering, reach out. There is always a caring soul who will help  you, even if you are quite literally alone in the world; more people care about  you than you can even begin to imagine."

        "Work": " Aim high, but don't have expectations of yourself or others that you or they can't possibly meet. Do your work with patience and with stamina and it will pay off for you in the long run. Your accomplishments will not be overlooked. ",
        "Love": " Often, before you can really have peace and wisdom in your relationships, you need to have peace within yourself. Look at what you feel guilty about, mistakes that you feel you've made in your past. Then forgive yourself, and let them go. It's the only way you can truly make progress.",
        "Finances": " There is likely to be a good balance between what is going out and what is coming in. However, if you need to increase or collect your earnings, you are going to have to ask for what you deserve. Have courage and pride, and you will not fail. ",
        "Health": " Balance and moderation is the key. Are you eating well, sleeping well, playing and working enough, getting enough exercise? Look at where you might be out of balance and then remedy this. Moderation is definitely the way to good health right now. ",
        "Spirituality": " This is an important time to meditate and to listen to your inner voice for guidance, and if you need help, to ask for it. Both from your higher self and from others."

        "General": " It's important for you to remember that no matter  what your situation, that you always have options to choose from. First things first, don't let other people tell you that  your options are limited. If  you come to that conclusion, be sure that you are coming to it on your own. Regardless, it will be  crucial to remember that you can free yourself from whatever restrictions are  holding you back, at any time you choose to do so. You may have the feeling  now that you are not in control of your life; sometimes this  happens as a result of your own actions, but more often as a byproduct of  inaction.  So, take action, take  whatever steps you can to give yourself the feeling, however slight, of being  in control. Even if that is merely making a choice on what you are going to  have for dinner. Small steps are important, too. ",
        "Work": " You may very well feel trapped in a job that you  detest but can't see your way clear to leave because of the security.  Consider whether or not the trade-offs are worth it; the truth of the matter is  that in this day and age, very few jobs, pensions, etc. and so forth are truly  secure. If you choose to stay where you are; be aware that this is a choice  that you are making, nothing has been foisted upon you. If you don't feel the  trade-off is worth your unhappiness, start putting out feelers and giving  thought to what you can do to change the situation. You are not trapped unless  you allow yourself  to be trapped.",
        "Love": " If you're in a long-term romantic relationship, one or  both parties may have gotten to the point where they feel as though they are  trapped in the situation. If you're getting signals that this is the case, try  to talk about it, if you want to save the relationship. This card also  sometimes appears when there is really nothing to be done but to end an unhappy  relationship. We always have choices. Take  steps to keep the magic alive. If you're seeking love, this may be a signal  that you're reaching the point of desperation, an attitude which definitely  drives off would-be lovers. If that's the case, consider taking a short time  out from relationship-seeking and get to know yourself better. Return to your  search when it's feeling less urgent. ",
        "Finances": " Things may be or may get very tight in the near  future. Try not to resent the situation, but to deal calmly and rationally with  it. Take one step at a time. If you need financial help, don't be afraid or too  proud to ask for it. Help is always available. If you're feeling flush right  now, this is still a time that calls for financial restraint. Save for the proverbial rainy  day! ",
        "Health": " This is a  time that you need to watch out for being overworked, overtired, and  over-stressed. Exercise will help, as will anything that helps you focus on the  problems faced by others rather than on your own problems. If you are dealing  with a chronic health condition, don't let it define you; you are more than  your diseases and  you are better served  by using any health challenges as an impetus for growth. ",
        "Spirituality": " Keeping a positive mindset is of the utmost  importance right now. Positive affirmations are important and will benefit you.  Take a look at who you surround yourself with. Are there upbeat, positive  people in your midst, or are you surrounded by overly critical, fault-finding  people who nitpick you to the point where you're depressed? Take stock, then  take action. Life is short, and attitudes are catching."

        "General": " It is  likely  that some people/situations that you have counted on as being there for you  may no longer be there in quite the same way. This doesn't have to be dire;  change is the nature of life, and trying to prevent it is like trying to row  upstream without a paddle. If  you have  been building castles in the air  this  may be the time that some of them come crashing down to earth. That's only a  problem if you let it be. You will be able to replace them with some more  realistic and reachable dreams and goals if some  fantasies fall apart this month. Dreaming is important, but it's  also important to be living in reality too. You will  get through this time just fine; particularly if you remember that you have all  the resources you need, already inside you, to deal with life and to do what  you need to do. ",
        "Work": " The energy of this time  lends itself toward arguments; try to keep your temper  under control, and not take everything that others say to heart too much.  Sudden reversals can happen now. This is not an indicator that you need to  panic. It is, however, an indicator that forewarned is forearmed. Even if you  think that you have the most stable job or sources of income in the world, what  would you do if it dried up tomorrow? Where might you go immediately for work  if you needed to? Thinking things through now, when you are not in a crisis,  may pay big dividends for you on down the road. If you hate your job, give  serious thought to making a change. You deserve to be happy.",
        "Love": " This can be (but is not necessarily) an indicator of a  relationship that is about to end. If you are in a relationship that you  absolutely, positively, don't want to see end, this is an important time for  damage control and for clear communications. Find out how your partner is  feeling/doing. Don't make assumptions. Find out for sure. ",
        "Finances": " This is not a time for risky investments,  gambling, or counting on the lottery to make things work out for you. Even if  you know the news will not be easy to stomach, find out exactly what you are  dealing with financially. It may not be as bad as you think. It is certain,  however, that you aren't making anything any better by avoiding the issues.  Deal with any problems in a straightforward manner. ",
        "Health": " Paying attention to what you are doing is critical  now. Be careful. Your nerves may be frayed, do whatever you need to do to calm  down and stay steady. Exercise can help with this. If you know what you're  doing (and know about your allergies, and your doctor approves) consider trying  relaxing herbs. Careful with drugs and alcohol now, if you  use any.",

        "Work": " Work should be going very well now. If  you're not happy in your current position,  this is a time when you can expect new opportunities to come flying into your  life if you are open to them. Be ready for them. Dust off your resume, read  tips and tactics about making positive career changes, and when opportunity  knocks, be prepared to answer. ",
        "Love": " This is an excellent time to meet someone new if you  are in the market for a new relationship.  If you're ready for  love, get out and mingle. A new relationship could happen at any time. If you're already committed, your  relationship may move to new, higher, more fulfilling levels.",
        "Finances": " Again, this is a very powerful positive omen. You  will do better financially than you imagined. This is a great time to take  risks (only those you can afford,) to ask for more money at your job, and to  sell things.  You'll have everything  that you need, more than likely, and then some. Enjoy it. ",
        "Health": " This should be a fabulous time, health wise. If you  are waiting on test results of some kind, they are likely to be very good  results. You'll be calm, and inspired. Take good care of yourself. ",
        "Spirituality": " You are so in touch with your  spirituality now that this is a great time for you to reach out to others, and  to share your wisdom and your joy.

Also, not that you need to  be mistrusting, but it will be helpful for you to realize that when this  card appears, it's possible that all is not what it  seems. If you feel  you can't trust someone, then you probably can't. Go  with your gut. If you are waiting on an answer from someone, it may,  unfortunately, take longer than you would like for it to. Try to stay patient. ",
        "Work": " Things unfortunately may not seem clear in the  slightest. Ask questions and practice active listening to make sure that you  and your co-workers understand each other perfectly. Again, patience is called  for. Stay calm, and particularly if you are feeling attacked, give your  co-workers and supervisors the benefit of any doubt. Reality may not be anywhere  close to as bad as you think. ",
        "Love": " This card points to a highly emotional time in love  relationships. Things can quickly become heated and/or uncomfortable. Take a  break if you need to. Don't make assumptions, and fight fairly, if you're going  to fight. Pick your battles and be sure to treat your lover like a friend.  Don't be in a hurry to end or to begin a relationship. This is probably not the  best time for either course of action. ",
        "Finances": " If you're waiting on financial decisions that need  to be made by others, the appearance of this card can imply that you'll need to  wait longer. This is not a time to \n  make business decisions based on anything other than  absolute concrete fact.  ",

If a diagnosis (whether that's positive or negative) doesn't feel  right, or you don't feel comfortable with your health care provider get a  second opinion or a new provider. For those that use alcohol or drugs, this is  a time when it is definitely easy to over do it. Indulge if you must but in  moderation. ",

This is a  good time to socialize, to meet new people, and to get out and about. ",

It's important, no matter what  happens, to keep your ego under control and to share any credit for good work  with those who work with you even if you did all or nearly all of the work!

        "Health": " Your health should be on the upswing. You may be helped by finding a healer who works with something besides traditional Western Medicine. This is not to replace medical therapy, but to work in concert with it. Your doctor may not be happy about this, if he tells you, for example, that it's not possible for you to study yoga and that it would \"get in the way\" of his treatment of your arthritis,  in that case, you may be best served by locating a different medical doctor as well. Follow your \"instincts\" about what is best for your health. Seek out mentors with more information than you have. Educate as much as you can. Advocate for yourself. ",
        "Spirituality": " You are likely to have several clear flashes of important spiritual insights during this time. Keep a notebook handy and record these.  Share and discuss them with others (even if your only outlet for that is online). We are all on a spiritual journey, and your insights are likely to be valuable for others as well. "
